# Product-Listing-Page

In this project, a responsive product listing webpage was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The goal was to create e-commerce-like website where users can filter, sort, and view products.

# Technologies Used:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Express - for server

# Features Implemented:

* Product Display: The product data was fetched from a JSON file and displayed as product cards. Each card contains the product name, description, price, and image.
* Filtering: Users can filter products by category, price, and color. Products are then dynamically displayed on the webpage updated according the filters.
* Sorting: Users can sort products by name (ascending/descending) or price (ascending/descending). Products are then updated and displayed.
* A "Load More" button allows users to load and display more products instead of loading a new page.
* Styling: CSS was used to style the webpage, including buttons, filters, product cards, and the footer.

# Challenges Faced:

* Dynamic Updates: Managing the dynamic updates of the product list based on user interactions.
* Filters, Sort Options, and Load More Button: This was to ensure that filtering or sorting products wouldn't interfere with the load more functionality. Ensuring that the load more button functioned correctly and displayed the next set of products while maintaining the current filter and sort settings.

# How to Start:

* Simply write in the terminal - node server.js
