# Product-Listing-Page

In this project, a responsive product listing webpage was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The goal was to create e-commerce-like website where users can filter, sort, and view products.

# Technologies Used:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Express - for server

# Features Implemented:

* Product Display: The product data was fetched from a JSON file and displayed as product cards. Each card contains the product name, description, price, and image.
* Filtering: Users can filter products by category, price, and color. Filtered products are dynamically updated on the webpage.
* Sorting: Users can sort products by name (ascending/descending) or price (ascending/descending). Sorting options are applied instantly.
* Pagination: A "Load More" button allows users to load and display more products instead of loading a new page.
* Styling: CSS was used to style the webpage, including buttons, filters, product cards, and the footer.

# Challenges Faced:

* Dynamic Updates: Managing the dynamic updates of the product list based on user interactions.
* Filters, Sort Options, and Load More Button: A significant challenge was to ensure that filtering or sorting products wouldn't interfere with the load more functionality. Ensuring that the load more button functioned correctly and displayed the next batch of products while maintaining the current filter and sort settings was a complex task
